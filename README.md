## ðŸ“‚ Projects Included

### ðŸ”¢ 1. Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset with ~99% accuracy.

- ðŸ“˜ Techniques: Image preprocessing, CNN architecture, training & evaluation
- ðŸ§ª Tools: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, NumPy, Google Colab


### ðŸ”¢ 2. Movie Recommender System (MovieLens)
A collaborative filtering-based recommender system built using cosine similarity on user ratings from the MovieLens dataset. This system suggests movies similar to a selected title based on user preferences.

- ðŸ“˜ Techniques: Item-based collaborative filtering, cosine similarity, sparse matrix handling, user-movie matrix creation, recommendation logic
- ðŸ§ª Tools: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, ipywidgets, Google Colab


### ðŸ”¢ 3. Fake News Detection & Explainability Web App
Built an end-to-end fake news classification system using TF-IDF vectorization and a Random Forest classifier, enhanced with SHAP explainability and deployed as an interactive web app using Gradio. The pipeline supports scalable PySpark preprocessing, MLflow experiment tracking, and SQLite-based prediction logging.

- ðŸ“˜ Techniques: TF-IDF vectorization, Random Forest classification, SHAP explainability, ROC analysis, PySpark preprocessing, ML lifecycle tracking
- ðŸ§ª Tools: Python, PySpark, scikit-learn, SHAP, MLflow, Gradio, SQLite, Google Colab


### ðŸ”¢ 4. Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT Transformer
Built a lightweight sentiment classification app using Hugging Faceâ€™s pretrained DistilBERT model, capable of identifying positive or negative sentiment in real-time. The project demonstrates fast prototyping using transformer pipelines and includes an interactive web UI powered by Gradio for end-user accessibility.

- ðŸ“˜ Techniques: Transformer-based sentiment classification, pipeline abstraction, real-time text prediction
- ðŸ§ª Tools: Python, Hugging Face Transformers, Gradio, Google Colab
