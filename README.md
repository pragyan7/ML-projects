## ðŸ“‚ Projects Included

### ðŸ”¢ 1. Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset with ~99% accuracy.

- ðŸ“˜ Techniques: Image preprocessing, CNN architecture, training & evaluation
- ðŸ§ª Tools: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, NumPy, Google Colab


### ðŸ”¢ 2. Movie Recommender System (MovieLens)
A collaborative filtering-based recommender system built using cosine similarity on user ratings from the MovieLens dataset. This system suggests movies similar to a selected title based on user preferences.

- ðŸ“˜ Techniques: Item-based collaborative filtering, cosine similarity, sparse matrix handling, user-movie matrix creation, recommendation logic
- ðŸ§ª Tools: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, ipywidgets, Google Colab
